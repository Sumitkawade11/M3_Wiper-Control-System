# Wiper Control System

In cars, a wiper control system replaces the standard wiper blade with an electrical component. In this setup, the ignition button (on the motor) will be controlled by a single switch in the ACC position. Switch on the wiper system with a second press, then vary the wiper speed with a third press, and finally turn off the motor with a fourth press. All of this was done with the help of LEDs and a simulation tool.A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. 

The previous method required manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this system is being presented as a solution to these problems. The project's goals are to supply wiping systems for older automobiles, improve the system by using actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for various functions by stepwise switching), and manage engine and wiper speed with a single switch. 

This System regulates the wiper's operation speed in response to the amount of rain. This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen.
